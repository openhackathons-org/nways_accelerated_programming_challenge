    "This is a simple simulation of an incompressible fluid flowing in a cavity using the 2D Navier-Stokes equation. The fluid flow can either be viscous (finite Reynolds number and vortices in the flow) on non-viscous (no Reynolds\n",

For simplicity, the liquid is assumed to have zero viscosity which implies that there can be no vortices (i.e. no whirlpools) in the flow. The cavity is a square box with an inlet on one side and an outlet on another as shown below:"
