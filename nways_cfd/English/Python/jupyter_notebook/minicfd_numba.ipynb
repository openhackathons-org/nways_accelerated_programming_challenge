    "\n",
    "3) Ignore the I/O function\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Ensure that only required data moves from `host (CPU function)` to `device (GPU function)` and vice versa\n",

    "5) Cross check the output after incremental changes to check algorithmic scalability\n",

    "**General tip:** Be aware of *Data Race* situation in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time. At least on thread tries to modify the variable. If data race happened, an incorrect result will be returned. So, make sure to validate your output against the serial version.\n",
