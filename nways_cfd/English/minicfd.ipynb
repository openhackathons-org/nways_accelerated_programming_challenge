    "## CFD Simulation\n",
    "In this bootcamp we will accelerate a Simple 2D regular-grid CFD simulation for teaching GPU programming using multiple approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "Learn how to write a portable parallel program that can run on multicore CPUs and accelerators like GPUs using OpenACC, OpenMP,std::par, CuPy, and Numba. Also learn how to optimize using lower level constructs using languages like CUDA-C. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bootcamp Duration\n",
    "The lab material is a challenge where the particiapnts will accelerate the application using mutiple approaches to GPU programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Level\n",
    "Beginner, Intermediate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Audience and Prerequisites\n",
    " The target audience for this tutorial is researchers, graduate students and developers who are interested in\n",
    "harnessing the power of GPUs to accelerate their scientific applications, and evaluate which programming approach best suites their needs. \n",
